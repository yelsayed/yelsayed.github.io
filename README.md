### 👋🏼 Hey there

For the past four years I've been building Meddy.com where you can find and book online doctors in Qatar and UAE. 

We've built some great stuff and we've written about it, you can check it out [here](https://medium.com/swlh/scaling-our-aws-infrastructure-9e64e6817b8c).

I'm currently working with SierraOne on building top of the line security technology that leverages machine learning to detect building security issues.

[This](https://yasser.codes) is my blog site where I'll be writing more and more about different interesting technologies that I built.
